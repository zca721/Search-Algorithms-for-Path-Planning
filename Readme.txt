Overall I had a really good experience with this, minus a few shot comings. My main short coming was getting the password one to accept the uppercase letter, 3 lowercase letters, number, and punctuations marks in any order. I search the web and tried all sorts of things and I just could not get it to work on my C program. I am not sure if it is just how C handles regex expressions or what, but I could not get it to work and ultimately ran out of time. My other short coming was with the date, I was not able to figure out the leap year and the dates associated with the month for out of bounds. For some I wrote a comment at the top that states what I set the restrictions too. I had a lot of fun, but ended up having to turn it in as is.

To run program just cd to the folder holding the C program and then run “make” and then can run the program by using “./regex.c”
